      "description": "Led development of a RAG-based 'About Us' and HR knowledge agent for UNC Health, using Milvus, Gemini, and PostgreSQL to deliver structured answers from unstructured clinical content. Led the design of an Insurance Eligibility Agent integrating clearinghouse APIs (Ideon, Optum), automating coverage verification, copay extraction, and structured EB benefit mapping. Contributed to the voice-based AI agent (Gemini Live + Telnyx) with real-time call control, voicemail detection, and multilingual support. Helped build FastAPI microservices for eligibility workflows, LLM inference orchestration, logging, and agent conversation tracking. Fine-tuned 10+ LLMs (e.g., Qwen 14B/7B, LLaMA 2-8B, Mixtral 8x7B) for content moderation on multi-class datasets using AWS S3 and Nebius; led junior contributors and optimized cost/performance. Built and deployed LLM inference APIs with FastAPI and Triton Inference Server.",
